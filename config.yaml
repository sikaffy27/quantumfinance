        nobody can ever change that. your songs, visual art, pictures, 3D items and

        code. Minting an NFT requires resources, access to infrastructure as well
        as careful planning. We provide the artists with all the tools to mint their
        NFT’s, but also the  community,  curation, the event space and resources in
