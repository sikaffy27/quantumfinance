**Bitcoin Mining**

How Bitcoin Mining Works

Where do bitcoins come from? With the traditional financial model, a central government decides when and how much money to print and where distribute it. Bitcoin doesn't have a central government and it is totally based on a peer to peer community.

With Bitcoin, miners use special software to solve math problems and are rewarded with a certain number of bitcoins in exchange for their work. This provides a smart way to issue the currency and also creates an incentive for more people to mine and to secure the network by leveraging hashing power (computing power).

**Helium Mining**

Mining HNT is done by installing a simple device on your office window which connects to the network using a new technology called LoRaWan. This works similar to WiFi, but has a longer range. This technology will be essential to our society's transition IOT & smart cities where all machines will be interconnected.

The worldâ€™s largest wireless network, Helium has over 234,000 Hotspots in over 20,600 cities and 141 countries. Hotspots provide miles of wireless network coverage for millions of devices around you using Helium LongFi, and you are rewarded in cryptocurrency (HNT) for doing this.

Helium mining requires only 5W of energy and is the most sustainable type of mining in the world.

**Chia Mining**

Chia is based upon an innovative technology called proof of space and time (PoST) which leverages the vast amounts of underused hard drive space. Yes, you can mine Chia by using your unused hard drives that you were gonna throw away.  _mining is based on the amount of hard drive storage space that you have available to use, but you're going to need a lot of it and thats where we can help you_

Chia is less energy intensive and more sustainable than more traditional forms of mining, while being just as secure and having higher ROI potential. Compared to proof of stake blockchains, Chia is much less vulnerable to attack or manipulation and does not suffer from the problem of "the rich get richer" and the centralizing effects of staking. Chia delivers the security and safety of Bitcoin along with the functional benefits of a purpose built and more secure environment.
